# CAR_WIPER
# Abstract
A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult to manage. As a result, this method is proposed to address these issues. The project's goals are to improve ageing automobiles' systems by giving automated transmission. wiping system, to enhance the system by including a sensor and an actuator, and to create a simple software that would completely work with the system the framework. This proposed wiper system's principle is comparable to those of other existing conventional wipers.
# Objective
The main objective of this project is to design ARM microcontroller based wiper control system. This project mainly on controlling the  wiper system.
# SWOT ANALYSIS
# STRENGTH
* Low Budget
* Automatic control of wiper system.
* Can prevent faults, and can prevent accidents.
# WEAKNESS
* High Cost
* Qute high cost for operations.
* Week Focus on Process Innovations
# OPPRONUTIES
* New Markets
* Demand for life saving Equipments
# THREATS
* Failure of operation might cause vision problem while driving.
# 4W and 1H
* What - automatic wiper system for vehicles.

* Why - To get to know about wiper system.

* When - It is used when the key turned ON/OFF where three LED's are turned ON/OFF.

* Where - IT is used in vehicle

* How - IT can be achieved by the analog to digital convertor.
