# CAR_WIPER
# Objective
The main objective of this project is to design ARM microcontroller based wiper control system. This project mainly on controlling the  wiper system.
# SWOT ANALYSIS
# STRENGTH
* Low Budget
* Automatic control of wiper system.
* Can prevent faults, and can prevent accidents.
# WEAKNESS
* High Cost
* Qute high cost for operations.
* 	Week Focus on Process Innovations
# OPPRONUTIES
* New Markets
*	Demand for life saving Equipments
# THREATS
* Failure of operation might cause vision problem while driving.
# 4W and 1H
* What - automatic wiper system for vehicles.

* Why - To get to know about wiper system.

* When - It is used when the key turned ON/OFF where three LED's are turned ON/OFF.

* Where - IT is used in vehicle

* How - IT can be achieved by the analog to digital convertor.
